This is the code for AIR LAB's ceiling rig interface.

||| SYSSTEM SPECIFICATIONS |||

The arduino is running the DMX simple library's SerialToDmx example. Make sure to match the baudrate of the arduino sketch (Serial.begin()) with the one in the Processing sketch.
Furthermore, if you are setting up a new arduino, make sure to change the name of the serial connection on line 62 under CONNECTION TO SERIAL DEVICES in the processing sketch. Use the serial in processing to find it.
